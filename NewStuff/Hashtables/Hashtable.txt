Hashtables are important and very useful for coding interviews.
Keep them at the top of your mind for problem solving.

A hashtable is an array containing keys and values. The Key is a string, while the Value can be anything. 

Hashtables can find, insert, and delete in O(1).

Hash Function: Takes in the key and maps it into an index in the array. 

Collision: Situation where two different keys to map to the same index. Differnt ways to manage Collisions.

Chaining: A method of managing Collisions. Store data in a linked list for each index in the array. Each node will store the data and the key.
